3 Description
Capacitive sensing with grounded capacitor sensors 
is a very low-power, low-cost, high-resolution contact-
less sensing technique that can be applied to a 
variety of applications ranging from proximity sensing 
and gesture recognition to material analysis and 
remote liquid level sensing. The sensor in a capacitive 
sensing system is any metal or conductor, allowing for 
low cost and highly flexible system design.
The FDC1004 is a high-resolution, 4-channel 
capacitance-to-digital converter for implementing 
capacitive sensing solutions. Each channel has a 
full scale range of ±15pF and can handle a sensor 
offset capacitance of up to 100pF, which can be either 
programmed internally or can be an external capacitor 
for tracking environmental changes over time and 
temperature. The large offset capacitance capability 
allows for the use of remote sensors.
The FDC1004 also includes shield drivers for sensor 
shields, which can reduce EMI interference and help 
focus the sensing direction of a capacitive sensor. 
The small footprint of the FDC1004 allows for use 
in space-constrained applications. The FDC1004 is 
available in a 10-pin WSON and VSSOP package and 
features an I2C interface for interfacing to an MCU.

(1) Electrical Characteristics Table values apply only for factory testing conditions at the temperature indicated. Factor testing conditions 
result in very limited self-heating of the device such that TJ=TA. No guarantee of parametric performance is indicated in the electrical 
tables under conditions of internal self-heating where TJ>TA. Absolute Maximum Ratings indicate junction temperature limits beyond 
which the device can be permanently degraded, either mechanically or electrically.
(2) Limits are ensured by testing, design, or statistical analysis at 25Degree C. Limits over the operating temperature range are ensured 
through correlations using statistical quality control (SQC) method.
(3) Typical values represent the most likely parametric norm as determined at the time of characterization. Actual typical values can vary 
over time and also depend on the application and configuration. The typical values are not tested and are not guaranteed on shipped 
production material.

6.3 Feature Description
6.3.1 The Shield
The FDC1004 measures capacitance between CINn and ground. That means any capacitance to ground on 
signal path between the FDC1004 CINn pins and sensor is included in the FDC1004 conversion result.
In some applications, the parasitic capacitance of the sensor connections can be larger than the capacitance of 
the sensor. If that parasitic capacitance is stable, the capacitance can be treated as a constant capacitive offset. 
However, the parasitic capacitance of the sensor connections can have significant variation due to environmental 
changes (such as mechanical movement, temperature shifts, humidity changes). These changes are seen as 
drift in the conversion result and can significantly compromise the system accuracy.
To eliminate the CINn parasitic capacitance to ground, the FDC1004 SHLDx signals can be used for shielding 
the connection between the sensor and CINn. The SHLDx output is the same signal waveform as the excitation 
of the CINn pin; the SHLDx is driven to the same voltage potential as the CINn pin. Therefore, there is no current 
between CINn and SHLDx pins, and any capacitance between these pins does not affect the CINn charge 
transfer. Ideally, the CINn to SHLD capacitance does not have any contribution to the FDC1004 result.
In differential measurements, SHLD1 is assigned to CHn and SHLD2 is assigned to CHm, where n < m. For 
instance in the measurement CIN1 – CIN2, where CHA = CIN1 and CHB = CIN2 (see Table 6-4), SHDL1 is 
assigned to CIN1 and SHDL2 is assigned to CIN2.

FDC1004
SNOSCY5C – AUGUST 2014 – REVISED OCTOBER 2024
Copyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9
Product Folder Links: FDC1004In a single-ended configuration, such as CINn versus GND, SHLD1 is internally shorted to SHLD2. In a single 
ended configuration, such as CINn versus GND with CAPDAC enabled, SHLD1 is assigned to the selected 
channel, SHLD2 is floating.
For best results, locate the FDC1004 as close as possible to the capacitive sensor. Minimize the connection 
length between the sensor and FDC1004 CINn pins and between the sensor ground and the FDC1004 GND pin. 
Shield the PCB traces to the CINn pins and connect the shielding to the FDC1004 SHLDx pins. In addition, if a 
shielded cable is used to connect the FDC1004 to the sensor, connect the shield to the appropriate SHLDx pin. 
In applications where only one SHLDx pin is used, the unused SHLDx pin can be left unconnected.
For more information on shielding, refer to Capacitive Sensing: Ins and Outs of Active Sensing application note.
6.3.2 The CAPDAC
The FDC1004 full-scale input range is ±15pF. The part can accept a higher capacitance on the input and 
the common-mode or offset (constant component) capacitance can be balanced by the programmable on-chip 
CAPDACs. The CAPDAC can be viewed as a negative capacitance connected internally to the CINn pin. The 
relation between the input capacitance and output data can be expressed as DATA = (CINn – CAPDAC), n = 
1...4. The CAPDACs have a 5-bit resolution, monotonic transfer function, are well matched to each other, and 
have a defined temperature coefficient.
6.3.3 Capacitive System Offset Calibration
The capacitive offset can be due to many factors including the initial capacitance of the sensor, parasitic 
capacitances of board traces, and the capacitance of any other connections between the sensor and the FDC.
The parasitic capacitances of the FDC1004 are calibrated out at production. If there are other sources of offset 
in the system, it can be necessary to calibrate the system capacitance offset in the application. Any offset in the 
capacitance input larger than ½ LSB of the CAPDAC should first be removed using the on-chip CAPDACs. Any 
residual offset of approximately 1pF can then be removed by using the capacitance offset calibration register. 
The offset calibration register is reloaded by the default value at power-on or after reset. Therefore, if the offset 
calibration is not repeated after each system power-up, the calibration coefficient value should be stored by the 
host controller and reloaded as part of the FDC1004 setup.
6.3.4 Capacitive Gain Calibration
The gain is factory calibrated up to ±15pF in the production for each part individually. The factory gain coefficient 
is stored in a one-time programmable (OTP) memory.
The gain can be temporarily changed by setting the Gain Calibration Register (registers 0x11 to 0x14) for the 
appropriate CINn pin, although the factory gain coefficient is restored after power-up or reset.
The part is tested and specified for use only with the default factory calibration coefficient. Adjusting the Gain 
calibration can be used to normalize the capacitance measurement of the CINn input channels.
6.4 Device Functional Modes
6.4.1 Single Ended Measurement
The FDC1004 can be used for interfacing to a single-ended capacitive sensor. In this configuration, connect the 
sensor to the input CINn (n = 1..4) pins of the FDC1004 and GND. The capacitance-to-digital convertor (without 
using the CAPDAC, CAPDAC= 0pF) measures the positive (or the negative) input capacitance in the range of 
0pF to 15pF. The CAPDAC can be used for programmable shifting of the input range. In this case it is possible to 
measure input capacitance in the range of 0pF to ±15pF which are on top of an offset capacitance up to 100pF. 
In single ended measurements with CAPDAC disabled SHLD1 is internally shorted to SHLD2 (see Figure 6-1); 
if CAPDAC is enabled SHLD2 is floating (see Figure 6-2). The single ended mode is enabled when the CHB 
register of the Measurements configuration registers (see Table 6-4) are set to b100 or b111.

6.4.2 Differential Measurement
When the FDC1004 is used for interfacing to a differential capacitive sensor, each of the two input capacitances 
must be less than 115pF. In this configuration the CAPDAC is disabled. Keep the absolute value of the difference 
between the two input capacitances below 15pF to avoid introducing errors in the measurement. In differential 
measurements, SHLD1 is assigned to CHn and SHLD2 is assigned to CHm, where n < m. For instance in 
the measurement CIN1 – CIN2, where CHA = CIN1 and CHB = CIN2 (see Table 6-4), SHDL1 is assigned to 
CIN1 and SHDL2 is to CIN2. Differential sensors made with S1 versus S3 and S2 versus S4 is shown below 
in Figure 6-3. S1 and S2 are alternatively connected to CHA and the S3 and S4 are alternatively connected to 
CHB, the shield signals are connected as explained in previous paragraph. The FDC1004 performs a differential

b100.
This configuration is very useful in applications where environment conditions need to be tracked. The 
differential measurement between the main electrode and the environment electrode makes the measurement 
independent of the environment conditions.

6.5 Programming
The FDC1004 operates only as a target device on the two-wire bus interface. Every device on the bus must 
have a unique address. Connection to the bus is made via the open-drain I/O lines, SDA, and SCL. The SDA 
and SCL pins feature integrated spike-suppression filters and Schmitt triggers to minimize the effects of input 
spikes and bus noise. The FDC1004 supports fast mode frequencies 10kHz to 400kHz. All data bytes are 
transmitted MSB first.
6.5.1 Serial Bus Address
To communicate with the FDC1004, the controller must first address target devices via a target address byte. 
The target address byte consists of seven address bits and a direction bit that indicates the intent to execute a 
read or write operation. The seven bit address for the FDC1004 is (MSB first): b101 0000.
6.5.2 Read/Write Operations
Access a particular register on the FDC1004 by writing the appropriate value to the Pointer Register. The pointer 
value is the first byte transferred after the target address byte with the R/W bit low. Every write operation to the 
FDC1004 requires a value for the pointer register. When reading from the FDC1004, the last value stored in 
the pointer by a write operation is used to determine which register is read by a read operation. To change the 
pointer register for a read operation, a new value must be written to the pointer. This transaction is accomplished 
by issuing the target address byte with the R/W bit low, followed by the pointer byte. No additional data is 
required. The controller can then generate a START condition and send the target address byte with the R/W 
bit high to initiate the read command. Note that register bytes are sent MSB first, followed by the LSB. A write 
operation in a read only registers such as MANUFACTURER ID or SERIAL ID returns a NACK after each 
data byte; read/write operation to unused address returns a NACK after the pointer; a read/write operation with 
incorrect I2C address returns a NACK after the I2C address.

The I2C interface of the FDC1004 is designed to operate with the standard I 2C transactions detailed in the I 2C 
specification; however it is not suitable for use in an I 2C system which supports early termination of transactions. 
A STOP condition or other early termination occurring before the normal end of a transaction (ACK) is not 
supported and can corrupt that transaction and/or the following transaction.
The device is also sensitive to any extraneous pulse on SDA during the SCL low period of the first bit position 
of the I 2C address byte. To ensure proper operation of the FDC1004, make sure the controller device does not 
transmit this type of waveform. An example of an unsupported I2C waveform is shown in Figure 6-6.

6.5.3 Device Usage
The basic usage model of the FDC1004 is to simply follow these steps:
1. Configure measurements (for details, refer to Measurement Configuration).
www.ti.com
FDC1004
SNOSCY5C – AUGUST 2014 – REVISED OCTOBER 2024
Copyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13
Product Folder Links: FDC10042. Trigger a measurement set (for details, refer to Triggering Measurements).
3. Wait for measurement completion (for details, refer to Wait for Measurement Completion).
4. Read measurement data (for details, refer to Read of Measurement Result).
6.5.3.1 Measurement Configuration
Configuring a measurement involves setting the input channels and the type of measurement (single-ended or 
differential).
The FDC1004 can be configured with up to 4 separate measurements, where each measurement can be any 
valid configuration (that is, a specific channel can be used in multiple measurements). There is a dedicated 
configuration register for each of the 4 possible measurements (for example, MEAS_CONF1 in register 0x08 
configures measurement 1, MEAS_CONF2 in register 0x09 configures measurement 2, ...). Configuring only one 
measurement is allowed, and it can be one of the 4 possible measurement configurations.
1. Setup the input channels for each measurement. Determine which of the 4 measurement configuration 
registers to use (registers 0x08 to 0x0A) and set the following:
a. For single-ended measurement:
i. Select the positive input pin for the measurement by setting the CHA field (bits[15:13]).
ii. Set CAPDAC (bits[9:5]) if the channel offset capacitance is more than 15pF.
b. For a differential measurement:
i. Select the positive input pin for the measurement by setting the CHA field (bits[15:13]).
ii. Select the negative input pin for the measurement by setting the CHB field (bits[12:10]). Note that 
the CAPDAC setting has no effect for a differential measurement.
2. Determine the appropriate sample rate. The sample rate sets the resolution of the measurement. Lower the 
sample rate higher is the resolution of the measurement.
6.5.3.2 Triggering Measurements
For a single measurement, trigger the desired measurement (that is, which one of the configured 
measurements) when needed by:
1. Setting REPEAT (Register 0x0C:bit[8]) to 0.
2. Setting the corresponding MEAS_x field (Register 0x0C:bit[7:4]) to 1.
• For example, to trigger a single measurement of Measurement 2 at a rate of 100S/s, set Address 0x0C to 
0x0540.
Note that, at a given time, only one measurement of the configured measurements can be triggered in this 
manner (that is, MEAS_1 and MEAS_2 cannot both be triggered in a single operation).
The FDC1004 can also trigger a new measurement on the completion of the previous measurement (repeated 
measurements). This is setup by:
1. Setting REPEAT (Register 0x0C:bit[8]) to 1.
2. Setting the corresponding MEAS_x field (Register 0x0C:bit[7:4]) to 1.
When the FDC1004 is setup for repeated measurements, multiple configured measurements (up to a maximum 
of 4) can be performed in this manner, but Register 0x0C must be written in a single transaction.
6.5.3.3 Wait for Measurement Completion
Wait for the triggered measurements to complete. When the measurements are complete, the corresponding 
DONE_x field (Register 0x0C:bits[3:0]) is set to 1.
6.5.3.4 Read of Measurement Result
Read the result of the measurement from the corresponding registers:
• 0x00/0x01 for Measurement 1
• 0x02/0x03 for Measurement 2
• 0x04/0x05 for Measurement 3
• 0x06/0x07 for Measurement 4

14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated
Product Folder Links: FDC1004The measurement results span 2 register addresses; both registers must be read to have a complete conversion 
result. The lower address (for example, 0x00 for Measurement 1) must be read first, then the upper address 
read afterwards (for example, 0x01 for Measurement 1).
When the measurement read is complete, the corresponding DONE_x field (Register 0x0C:bits[3:0]) returns to 0.
If an additional single triggered measurement is desired, simply perform the Trigger, Wait, Read steps again.
If the FDC1004 is set up for repeated measurements (Register 0x0C:bit[8]) = 1), the FDC1004 continuously 
measures until the REPEAT field (Register 0x0C:bit[8]) is set to 0, even if the results are not read back.

Registers from 0x15 to 0xFD are reserved and should not be written to.
6.6.1 Registers
The FDC1004 has an 8-bit pointer used to address a given data register. The pointer identifies which of the 
data registers should respond to a read or write command on the two-wire bus. This register is set with every 
write command. A write command must be issued to set the proper value in the pointer before executing a read 
command. The power-on reset (POR) value of the pointer is 0x00.
6.6.1.1 Capacitive Measurement Registers
The capacitance measurement registers are 24-bit result registers in binary format (the 8 LSBs D[7:0] are always 
0x00). The result of the acquisition is always a 24 bit value, while the accuracy is related to the selected 
conversion time (refer to Electrical Characteristics ). The result of the measurement can be calculated by the 
following formula:

6.6.1.4 Offset Calibration Registers
These registers configure a digitized capacitance value in the range of -16pF to 16pF (max residual offset 250 
aF) that can be added to each channel in order to remove parasitic capacitance due to external circuitry. In 
addition to the offset calibration capacitance which is a fine-tune offset capacitance, it is possible to support 
a larger offset by using the CAPDAC (for up to 100pF). These 16-bit registers are formatted as a fixed point 
number, where the first 5 bits represents the integer portion of the capacitance in Two’s complement format, and 
the remaining 11 bits represent the fractional portion of the capacitance.

Note
Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, 
and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for 
determining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design 
implementation to confirm system functionality.
7.1 Application Information
7.1.1 Liquid Level Sensor
The FDC1004 can be used to measure liquid level in non-conductive containers. Capacitive sensors can be 
attached to the outside of the container or be located remotely from the container, allowing for contactless 
measurements. The working principle is based on a ratiometric measurement; Figure 7-1  shows a possible 
system implementation which uses three electrodes. The Level electrode provides a capacitance value 
proportional to the liquid level. The Reference Environmental electrode and the Reference Liquid electrode are 
used as references. The Reference Liquid electrode accounts for the liquid dielectric constant and its variation, 
while the Reference Environmental electrode is used to compensate for any other environmental variations 
that are not due to the liquid itself. Note that the Reference Environmental electrode and the Reference Liquid 
electrode are the same physical size (hREF).
For this application, single-ended measurements on the appropriate channels are appropriate, as the tank is 
grounded.
Use the following formula to determine the liquid level from the measured capacitances:
(0) 
Lev Lev
ref
RL RE
C C Level h C C 
where
• CRE is the capacitance of the Reference Environmental electrode,
• CRL is the capacitance of the Reference Liquid electrode,
• CLev is the current value of the capacitance measured at the Level electrode sensor,
• CLev(0) is the capacitance of the Level electrode when the container is empty, and
• hREF is the height in the desired units of the Container or Liquid Reference electrodes.
7.1.2 
The ratio between the capacitance of the level and the reference electrodes allows simple calculation of the 
liquid level inside the container itself. Very high sensitivity values (that is, many LSB/mm) can be obtained due to 
the high resolution of the FDC1004, even when the sensors are located remotely from the container.
For more information on a robust liquid level sensing technique, refer to the Capacitive Sensing: Out-of-Phase 
Liquid Level Technique  application note  and the TIDA-00317 Capacitive-Based Liquid Level Sensing Sensor 
Reference Design.

7.2.1 Design Requirements
Make sure the liquid level measurement is independent of the liquid, which can be achieved using the 3-
electrode design described above. Moreover, make sure the sensor is immune to environmental interferences 
such as a human body, other objects, or EMI. This can be achieved by shielding the side of the sensor which 
does not face the container.
7.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure
In capacitive sensing systems, the design of the sensor plays an important role in determining system 
performance and capabilities. In most cases the sensor is simply a metal plate that can be designed on the 
PCB.
The sensor used in this example is implemented with a two-layer PCB. On the top layer, which faces the 
tank, there are the 3 electrodes (Reference Environmental, Reference Liquid, and Level) with a ground plane 
surrounding the electrodes. The bottom layer is covered with a shield plane in order to isolate the electrodes 
from any external interference sources.
Depending on the shape of the container, the FDC1004 can be located on the sensor PCB to minimize the 
length of the traces between the input channels and the sensors and increase the immunity from EMI sources. 
In case the shape of the container or other mechanical constraints do not allow having the sensors and the 
FDC1004 on the same PCB, the traces which connect the channels to the sensor need to be shielded with the 
appropriate shield. In this design example all of the channels are shielded with SHLD1. For this configuration, 
the FDC1004 measures the capacitance of the 3 channels versus ground; and so the SHLD1 and SHLD2 pins 
are internally shorted in the FDC1004 (see The Shield).
7.2.3 Application Curve
The data shown below has been collected with the FDC1004EVM. A liquid level sensor with 3 electrodes like 
the one shown in the schematic was connected to the EVM. The plot shows the capacitance measured by the 3 
electrodes at different levels of liquid in the tank. The capacitance of the Reference Liquid (the RF trace in the 
graph below) and Reference Environmental (the RE trace) sensors have a steady value when the liquid is above 
their height while the capacitance of the level sensor (Level) increases linearly with the height of the liquid in the 
tank.

Product Folder Links: FDC10047.3 Best Design Practices
Avoid long traces to connect the sensor to the FDC1004. Short traces reduce parasitic capacitances between 
shield versus input channel and parasitic resistance between input channel versus GND and shield versus GND.
The sensor in many cases is simply a metal surface on a PCB, therefore the sensor must be protected with 
solder resist to avoid short circuits and limit any corrosion. Any change in the sensor can result in a change in 
system performance.
7.4 Initialization Set Up
At power on the device is in stand-by. It stays in this mode until a measurement is triggered.
7.5 Power Supply Recommendations
The FDC1004 requires a voltage supply within 3V and 3.6V. Two multilayer ceramic bypass X7R capacitors of 
0.1 μF and 1 μF, respectively between VDD and GND pin are recommended. Make sure the 0.1 μF capacitor is 
closer to the VDD pin than the 1μF capacitor.
7.6 Layout
7.6.1 Layout Guidelines
The FDC1004 measures the capacitances connected between the CINn (n=1..4) pins and GND. To get the 
best result, locate the FDC1004 as close as possible to the capacitive sensor. Minimize the connection length 
between the sensor and FDC1004 CINn pins and between the sensor ground and the FDC1004 GND pin. If a 
shielded cable is used for remote sensor connection, connect the shield to the SHLDm (m=1...2) pin according 
to the configured measurement.
7.6.2 Layout Example
Figure 7-3 below is optimized for applications where the sensor is not too far from the FDC1004. Each channel 
trace runs between 2 shield traces. This layout allows the measurements of 4 single ended capacitance or 2 
differential capacitance. The ground plane needs to be far from the channel traces, it is mandatory around or 
below the I2C pin.

8.5 Electrostatic Discharge Caution
This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD. Texas Instruments recommends that all integrated circuits be handled 
with appropriate precautions. Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures can cause damage.
ESD damage can range from subtle performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision integrated circuits may 
be more susceptible to damage because very small parametric changes could cause the device not to meet its published 
specifications.
