## Continuous learning
- When you learn new project knowledge, coding style, or preferences during a session, update `AGENTS.md` (and `README.md` if it affects users) before finishing so the next agent benefits.

## Repo tips
- Source components live under `components/`; prefer scoped changes there unless asked otherwise.
- Run `./check.bash` to perform `clangd --check` over C/C++ sources (or pass a file path for a single-file check).
